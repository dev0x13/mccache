Title: BU Computer Science 1998 Proxy Trace
Author: Adam D. Bradley <artdodge@cs.bu.edu>
Date: September 7, 1999

Abstract:

In a recent paper (Changes in Web Client Access Patterns:
Characteristics and Caching Implications by Barford, Bestavros,
Bradley, and Crovella) we performed a variety of analyses upon user
traces collected in the Boston University Computer Science department
in 1995 and 1998.  A sanitized version of the 1995 trace has been
publicly available for some time; the 1998 trace has now been
sanitized, and is available from:

      http://www.cs.bu.edu/techreports/1999-011-usertrace-98.gz
      ftp://ftp.cs.bu.edu/techreports/1999-011-usertrace-98.gz

This memo discusses the format of this public version of the log,
and includes additional discussion of how the data was collected,
how the log was sanitized, what this log is and is not useful for,
and areas of potential future research interest.
